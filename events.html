                <p class="card-text">The Great Exchange is an event held to have intentional conversations about Jesus with students here on campus. We ask students who are walking by if they would like to do a survey on their spritual beliefs. The survey provides a great way to meet new poeple and hear what they believe about God. It also gives you a great opportunity to share the testimonmy of God's work in your life. This event is great for anyone who wants to share their faith in Jesus. If you have never shared your faith before, this is a great opportunity to begin to let God use you to bring others to Him!</p>
                <p>The event is held two to three times a semseter on Skiles Walkway from 10AM to 2PM. </p>

                <p class="card-text">A hard-driving journalist, Lee Strobel was exactly where he expected to be at work: on top. His award-winning investigative reporting recently earned him a promotion to legal editor at the ChicagoTribune. But things weren't going nearly as well at home where his wife Leslie's newfound faith in Christ went against everything Lee believed-or didn't believe-as an avowed atheist. Utilizing his journalistic and legal training, Lee begins a quest to debunk the claims of Christianity in order to save his crumbling marriage. Chasing down the biggest story of his career, Lee comes face-to-face with unexpected results that could change everything he knows to be true. It is based on Lee Strobel's award-winning bestselling book and stars Mike Vogel, Erika Christensen, Faye Dunaway, and Robert Forster. It's an ideal movie for anyone who has ever pondered the existence of God ... and what role He could play in their lives.</p>
