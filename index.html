      <h2>Evangelism as Salty Grace</h2>
      <h3>By Justin Nicoara</h3>
      <p>Colossians 4:2-6</p>
      <h4>How to be Annoying</h4>
      <p> As Christians, we always talk about and say to do everything in the name of Jesus. Our faith in Jesus, our new life in Jesus, radically affects what we do. It causes us to stop doing somethings and radically affects the way we do everything else. Many people though, most people even, are not going to get the “in the name of Jesus” thing. In fact, if you’ve tried it at all recently, you probably got some weird looks. This has the potential to make you really weird. Weird can be good and bad. It can mean unusual, surprising, but in an interesting and intriguing way or it can mean awkward, slightly gross, or even offensive.
      </p>
      <p>A lot of people cringe at the word “evangelism”. It makes a lot of people feel guilty. We hear that we must be a “witness” for God, but what does that mean? Witness already has a negative connation from the way people think of Jehovah Witnesses. If we approach people this way, we will be annoying or weird, the bad kind. So how should we approach people then?
      </p>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>We should approach people with relational evangelism. A natural, organic evangelism that seeps into our daily life. That brings me to Colossians.
        </p>
        <p>Paul, the evangelist, church planter, gives us his 30 second guide to effective evangelism. It sums up into three parts: pray for open doors, watch for open doors, and speak and act at all time in such a way that opens doors. In our regular conversations with non-Christians, we are to be delightfully graceful while fully using every opportunity (vs. 6). 
        </p>
            
        <p>Colossians 4:2-6 “2 Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. 3 And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains. 4 Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should. 5 Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. 6 Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.”
    </p>



        <h4>Pray for Open Doors</h4>
        <p>It starts with prayer. We should be in prayer constantly. In order to effectively tell someone about God, we need to be prepared before we even approach them. Talk to God about your friends before you talk to your friends about God. Paul even shares his secret, pray for open doors for the word (or the mystery of Christ).
        </p>
        <p>A lot of times we, and even myself, mistake a slightly cracked door for an open door. Someone is peeking out their door and we go in full force, try to kick the door open, smash it into their face, and then rub their bleeding nose into the truth, “YOU NEED JESUS!” This is simply not effective. Remember the bad weird we talked about earlier? Yeah, this would be it.
        </p>
        <p>There are friends you know so well that you just walk in their house. There are other friends you ring the doorbell and wait for them to answer the door. There is an awkward stage between those two where we feel out of place. You see a door that might be open. You walk up to it. You knock. You ask, “Is this door open?” You test it out. You half step in, look around to see if anyone is home. You listen for the, “Come on in.”
        </p>
        <p>So, in practice, what does this look like practically? Someone might ask you a straight out question: What do you believe? And then you have an awesome opportunity to share because that door is wide open. But more often than not, someone doesn’t just ask what you believe, but rather, they start sharing their story, and you get to ask questions about it. And a lot of times they even ask for your story, and you have an amazing opportunity to test and see how open that door is and tell them your story, and your story is part of God’s story.
        </p>
        <p>
        Does it always work this way? No. Is it always easy? No, Paul is in prison.
        </p>
        <h4>Watch for Open Doors</h4>
        <p>Next, Paul challenges the people in Colossi to use his evangelistic strategy. What is that strategy? It starts with being on the constant lookout for open doors. Wisely. Verse 5 says to be wise in the way you act towards outsiders. That literally means to walk around in wisdom. Is it wise barging in and attempting to shove Jesus down someone’s throat? Is it wise to make you seem awkward, unapproachable, or offensive? Walk in wisdom as if each moment counts.
        </p>
        <h4>Speak and Act in a Way to Open Doors</h4>
        <p>Verse 5 says to “make the most of every opportunity.” A good analogy is black Friday shopping. We go out at crazy hours and walk around stores trying to spot amazing deals and walk off with a shopping cart full of random items. In this context, you are walking around, wisely, with eyes open to spot opportunities, or open doors, and then make the full use of the opportunity. I think one amazing way to approach people is with the mindset that we are one beggar telling another beggar where to find bread, the bread of life. We are at the same level as them. We are sinners and we need to approach them with a heart and mindset knowing that we are not better than them. We need Jesus as much as anyone else. 
        </p>
        <p>In verse 6, he adds a practical aspect to “wisdom.” We are to fill every moment, every conversation, with grace. And when we do, it is as if we are seasoning, or salting, our conversation, making it delicious, or enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p> People love to be shown grace. What is grace? Grace is unmerited favor, getting something you don’t deserve. If we add grace to that aspect of wisdom in our conversations, people will enjoy conversations as opposed to arguing and feeling defensive (for the most part).
        </p>
        <h4>Grace vs. Opportunity</h4>
        <p>Speaking of grace, we have this battle between opportunity and grace. Some people believe that they must take full advantage of every opportunity and in order to be so, they might have to be a little graceless. We get sidetracked and believe that we have to tell the whole gospel story and be so effective that we bring them right across the “finish line” and they become believers right then and there. 
        </p>
        <p>On the other side, some us are naturally salty (or full of grace, haha). We want peace with everyone and don’t want to ruffle feathers. We don’t want to annoy anyone or be “pushy.” We can be so allergic to being offensive that we let opportunities slide by. 
        </p>
        <p>These are both on extreme opposite sides of the spectrum, but each and every person in this room can find themselves somewhere on that spectrum. But this isn’t a case where we have to balance and find a medium, it’s a case where we have to encompass both! John chapter 1 says Jesus was “full of grace… and truth.” He did both. Jesus spoke powerfully, clearly, took advantage of every opportunity, but was always full of grace. He spoke hard truths yet prostitutes and tax collectors still loved hanging out with him. But they weren’t just comfortable with him, they were transformed by their time with Him. He was both full of grace and truth. 
        </p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Pray for open doors (talk to God about your friends before you talk to your friends about God).
        </p>
        <p>
        Look for open doors.
        </p>
        <p>
        Speak and act in a way to open doors. Walk around wisely. Wise in the way you speak and act with outsiders. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Along each and every step, be delicious, full of salt.
        </p>
        <p>This applies so directly to our motto, <em>“Christ-led disciples making disciples.”</em> Bring light into the darkness. I believe this is such an exciting, effective model for evangelism. It’s simple to follow and it isn’t new. Paul gave it to us a long time ago. 
        </p>
        <p><em>Here are some questions to consider:</em>
            <ul>
                <li>How do we pray for open doors?</li>
                <li>How do we watch for open doors?</li>
                <li>How do we speak and act for open doors?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
